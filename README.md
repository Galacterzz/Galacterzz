# Hi, I'm Anirudha Shinde ðŸ‘‹
### Mechanical Engineer | Data Science & Machine Learning Enthusiast

I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at IIT Bombay with a passion for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. I enjoy solving complex problems through innovative projects and contributing to open-source communities. When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing football or exploring new technologies.
